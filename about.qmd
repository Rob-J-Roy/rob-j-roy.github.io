I received my B.A. in Psychology and English from Saint Joseph's University in 2019. I remained at Saint Joseph's to receive my M.S. in Experimental Psychology in 2020 under the supervision of Dr. Elizabeth Becker in her Behavioral Neuroendocrinology Lab. 

After graduatiing, I began my first job at Tulane university conducting clinical research trials for the Johnson and Johnson Covid-19 vaccine. From this position I transferred to the Early Psychosis Intervention clinic, the largest early psychosis intervention clinic in Louisiana, to establish their research program. 

Currently, I am a PhD student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln under the supervision of Dr. Nicholas Hubbard. In my free time I enjoy cooking, writing prose, and reading.
